\section{Introduction}
Mathematics is the foundation of our modern world \cite{roman}. It is applied to many areas of life; politics, medicine, epidemiology, and economics \cite{roman}. Thus, it is important that we have effective ways of teaching mathematics to students at the university level. There is no single method for teaching mathematics, throughout the years we, as a society, have developed many teaching techniques, each of which having their own advantages. We will first discuss the gap students face when transitioning from secondary school to university. Then we will analyze three teaching theories, to help universities better understand the range of available strategies and what they possibly should and should not include when teaching mathematics.     

\subsection{High School to University Gap}
To accomplish this we must first examine the noticeable gap in the transition from high school to university. There is a high drop out rate of university students in mathematics across the world, some ranging up to 50$\%$ \cite{Vollstedt2014}. The gap that leads to these dropout rates is extremely complex, there is no single reason as to why it exists. So, we will discuss the most prevalent reasons for this gap. The transition from high school to university math is difficult for many students, including those who excelled in high school (cite). Studies have shown that these struggles are often a result of the change in the teaching of the the subject and the change of the subject itself. A paper by blank describes university mathematics as a "different character" \cite{Vollstedt2014}, explaining that it is more formal and, at the early levels, hardly focuses on real world applications. Essentially, math in university is fundamentally different from high school math. Students are introduced to proofs and more formal definitions, which they will have little to no exposure to at the secondary school level. An additional reason for this gap is in university, mathematics is presented to the students, who are then required to apply their own learning strategies, whereas in secondary school the content is presented in a very specific and acceptable way for the students \cite{Vollstedt2014}. These are some examples of why this gap exists.
