\section{Introduction}
Mathematics is the foundation of our modern world \cite{roman}. It is applied to many areas of life; politics, medicine, epidemiology, and economics \cite{roman}. Thus, it is important that we have effective ways of teaching mathematics to students at the university level. There is no single method for teaching mathematics, throughout the years we, as a society, have developed many teaching techniques, each of which having their own advantages. We will first discuss the gap students face when transitioning from secondary school to university. Then we will analyze three teaching theories, to help universities better understand the range of available strategies and what they possibly should and should not include when teaching mathematics.     

\subsection{High School to University Gap}
To accomplish this we must first examine the noticeable gap in the transition from high school to university. There is a high drop out rate of university students in mathematics across the world, some ranging up to 50$\%$ \cite{Vollstedt2014}. The gap that leads to these dropout rates is extremely complex, there is no single reason as to why it exists. So, we will discuss the most prevalent reasons for this gap. The transition from high school to university math is difficult for many students, including those who excelled in high school (cite). Studies have shown that these struggles are often a result of the change in the teaching of the the subject and the change of the subject itself. A paper by blank describes university mathematics as a "different character" \cite{Vollstedt2014}, explaining that it is more formal and, at the early levels, hardly focuses on real world applications. Essentially, math in university is fundamentally different from high school math. Students are introduced to proofs and more formal definitions, which they will have little to no exposure to at the secondary school level. An additional reason for this gap is in university, mathematics is presented to the students, who are then required to apply their own learning strategies, whereas in secondary school the content is presented in a very specific and acceptable way for the students \cite{Vollstedt2014}. These are some examples of why this gap exists.
\subsection{Traditional Lecture-based Instruction}
The most traditional teaching method is Lecture-based instruction. This method is meant to allow for key concepts to be presented to a large number of students. It involves an instructor who presents the content to students in a structured format. In this format the instructor acts as the main source of information, and the students take notes\cite{Maryland}. Lecture-based Instruction has the advantageous of pacing, many concepts can be covered in a short period of time. It is effective in learning the core idea's of the presented content and can is beneficial for immediate recall\cite{Maryland}. Though, this method is used so frequently it does not come without it's disadvantages. This structure lacks long-term retention, where students retain information for their exams and forget most of it later. The instruction is a one pace fits all instruction, many students have a preferred speed to have content presented to them, but in this method they have no control over it\cite{Maryland}. Some studies have shown that lecture-based instruction results in a higher fail rate compared to other teaching methods. One study metaanalyzied 225 studies that has data on examination scores or failure rates in STEM. In this study they concluded that students in traditional lecture-based instruction were 1.5 times more likely to fail that students who were in classes that used active learning \cite{Freeman}.
\section{Theories of Teaching Mathematics}
\subsection{Theory Selection}
The three theories we will discuss are Behaviorist Theory, Inquiry-Based learning, and Blended Learning. Behaviorist Theory connects learning to the relationship between stimulus and response(cite). An example of behaviorist Theory is students being given assignments where they are required to solved various mathematical problems and  are either positively reinforced or negatively reinforced depending on their grade. This is a method that is used in almost every course at Memorial University of Newfoundland (MUN). Inquiry-Based learning redirected the responsibility for learning to the students, allowing them to arrive at an understanding themselves (queensuniversity). This is a method that is seen less at memorial university and students may be less familiar with this technique. The final learning technique is blended learning. Blended learning can be used as a broad term used to a plethora of approaches, but all approached used under the Blended Learning umbrella agreed that it involves a combination of in-person and online learning (cite dalhousie). 

\subsection{Behaviorist Theory}
Zong Shan explains how behaviorism is used to reinforce mathematical instruction\cite{shan2021}. In the context of mathematics we can see this reinforcement through assignments, quizzes and tests, where correct answers are rewarded with good grades. However, behaviorism is learning through the change of observable behavior, which is done by reinforcement\cite{shan2021}. This method may not fully promote a deep level of understanding. Students may focus more on producing correct answers for a grade, rather then fully understating how they arrived at their answer. Despite this issue, behaviorism, like many of the teaching techniques, has it's advantages. Behaviorism provides a clear structure. It can benefit algebra skills, along with other styles of mathematics that are more precedential based because students are being constantly tested with on similar style questions. Many MUN students would be familiar with this method in calculus I and II, where many assignments would require solving derivative and integrals, step by step. Thus, based on this analysis, we can concluded that Behaviorism can be effective at times, though alone, it likely will not provide students with a well-rounded understanding of the course content. 
\subsection{Inquiry-Based learning}
Inquiry-Based learning contrasts significantly with Behaviorist Instruction, with it's main goal to allow students to explore their own questions, allowing for deeper understanding of a topic through their investigation. Wynne Harlen discusses the benefits of learning through inquiry. Harlen explains how this method can develop understanding and reasoning. It builds critical thinking and encourages collaboration and discussion\cite{Harlen2013}, all of which are important skills for mathematics students to have, specifically, those who intend to pursue mathematics beyond university. A main issue involving inquiry-based learning is the problem with assessments. Traditional tests are not effective in testing inquiry skills, since standardized tests in mathematics tend to emphasis memorization\cite{Harlen2013}. Harlen also discusses the implementation of inquiry-based learning and how many teachers interpret it as students doing all of the work alone, which is not the case. This is paired with the fact that some topics are less suitable for inquiry learning than others \cite{Harlen2013}. Based on this analysis inquiry appears to develop critical skills, and students may find inquiry learning more engaging, since they are typically required to discuss topics with classmates. Depending on the course material implementing some level of inquiry could be beneficial for the students to develop a deeper understanding. This learning method is less prevalent at MUN, however, many students who encounter it, appear to have positive experiences.

\subsection{Blended Learning}
Blended learning has seen a rise since COVID-19, when universities were forced to transfer to online learning. Numerous students have expressed liking this method. Blended learning is meant to combine the convenience of online courses with in-person interactions with professors\cite{Nikolopoulou}. Abeer Ali Okaz discusses the advantages of blended learning, saying it allows for both independent and collaborative learning. It increases access to information and can teach students self-regulation (Integrating Blended Learning in Higher Education). Despite the advantages there are negatives to blended learning. With blended learning comes a lack of participation when online, compared to face-to-face lectures. The online aspect can also lead to a lack of classroom community. A crucial aspect of blended learning is technology, this leads to limitations including individuals having accesses to the proper technology and the possibility of power outages. Based on this research, Blended-learning appears to be well-liked and on the rise. Many courses at MUN have yet to implement blended learning, but it appears that it could be a method implemented in the future.

\section{Improving the Teaching of Mathematics}
Thus far, it is clear that there is no perfect teaching method. Some methods appear to work better depending the the course content. Yet, simply applying a singular teaching method as is does not appear to be fully effective. As a result, through the studying of different teaching methods, individuals have created enhancement methods to improve students learning in mathematics. Some of these methods include active learning, SOMETHING, SOMETHING.

Some of these methods include active learning, enhancement method 2, enhancement method 3.

\subsection{Active Learning}
Active learning takes a different approach to instruction. It forces students to fully engage with the course material and their classmates. The professor is still crucial for guiding the students, but active learning places more responsibility on the students. This method is not meant to replace lectures, but to integrate tasks during a lecture to increase engagement and lead to deeper learning \cite{Active_learning}. In an analysis course students could be asked to work together to solve a harder proof or in a calculus class a difficult integral that requires multiple solving techniques. Most classes at MUN are strictly lecture based, changing that would be difficult. However, as we discussed, lecture based courses do not always allow for deep learning of a subject, it would seem that adding active learning could increase understanding at MUN as it has in other places \cite{Freeman}.

\subsection{Personal Insight}
Based on everything discussed I believe effective learning starts with engagement. The majority of courses students will encounter are lecture based. A structure that has students taking notes, with little to no contribution. For some individuals, this may be beneficial, however, in reality, for many it is not. A very crucial aspect in instruction is engagement from the professor. Many learning techniques discuss student engagement and the impact that has. The best way to promote engagement is for the professor to initiate it themselves. When a professor is engaging it creates a welcoming environment, something that can allow students to feel comfortable to ask questions and discuss topics with classmates. When a professor shows enthusiasm it can increase students motivation to learn the topic. Ultimately, every method of instruction has its benefits.  Strictly following one teaching method is not the most effective way. Based on my analysis, effective teaching is when professors use a combination of teaching methods to create the best possible learning environment for students, while trying to increase their engagement.
